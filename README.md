# Implement Member System (CRUD) with Firebaseâ€™s Realtime Database in PHP
This is a simple member login, logout and membership creation demo created using Firebase's Realtime Database and PHP. The application uses PHP to create the basic page structure and services and utilises html default UI components and styles without the addition of any CSS.

This program is based on the tutorial in this Youtube video by Devisty.<br>
(Youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrcYfJiG-I8&ab_channel=Devisty)

In this demo you can see a basic PHP membership system. You can create a Realtime Database membership system by linking your Firebase's Realtime Database to the config.php file of the demo.

However, this is only a demonstration of how to use Firebase's Realtime Database in PHP, for security reasons it is not recommended to use Realtime Database as a membership system for your application. If you want to set up a real membership system it is recommended that you use Firebase's built-in Authentication.
